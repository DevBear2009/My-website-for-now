          <h2>Redesign of the game!</h2>
          <p>This time I couldn't have excuses, because the game is out for quite some time and I hope that it will start gaining some traction after the next upate in wich I will try to make something out of this, so called demo wich it tecnicially is. In this update that happened not so long ago I have redesigned the graphics and fixed some bugs that I have found. I really hope you people like it and we shall se you in the future. Bye :)</p>
